# Sounding Viewer

An open source sounding viewer and editor. The application provides a simple interface to choose and download radiosonde observations and model forecasts (currently GFS only). It allows modification of the input data so that the change of instability indices and the diagram can be observed easily. The development is focused on computing and visualizing thermals used by paragliders, but many indices for storm forecasts are also provided.
